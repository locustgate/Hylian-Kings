conversion0_desc;With the new Hyrulean rulers the Sarians of [Root.GetName] have stoped speaking Saria and started speaking Hylian. With each passing generation the number of children with rounded ears decrease and those with hylian ears increases.;;;;;;;;;x
conversion0A;They are West Hyruleans now.;;;;;;;;;x

conversion3_desc;There was a recent panic as instead of zora tadpoles, children are born with the look of humans with bird like beaks. Some of the populace claim it is a blessing from Valoo and others claim it is a curse by the water spirits.;;;;;;;;;x
conversion3A;We will call these new creatures after the Zora word for bird, Rito.;;;;;;;;;x
conversion3B;These creatures are surely Valoo's chosen people.;;;;;;;;;x
conversion4_desc;There was a recent panic as the tadpoles developed in the shallow rivers of [Root.GetName] developed in to large scaled creatures. These children have proven to be more violent than other Zora. So far the residents have started calling them Zola after an ancient evil water spirit.;;;;;;;;;x

conversion6A;Yes this will help with trade.;;;;;;;;;x
conversion7_desc;Around the islands more people use this Port language and it helps us converse with citizens from a hundred lands. We continue to use our influence to promote this means of communication for most who we do business.;;;;;;;;;x
conversion7A;We are wise;;;;;;;;;x
conversion8_desc;Although every civilized being in Hyrule know Hylian is the true language of communication, this new Port language does have functionality. I have therefore prevailed upon a member of my court to adopt this for everyday use.;;;;;;;;;x
conversion8A;A most useful development;;;;;;;;;x
conversion9_desc;I was considering important business when I had an amazing insight. To strengthen my holdings I must bring my vassals round to my way of thinking. This involves communication. If I can get them to communicate like me then I will have a much smoother running business.;;;;;;;;;x

conversion10A;This will surely be profitable.;;;;;;;;;x
conversion11_desc;As the Morians in the Grindle lands settle and adapt to their new terrain most of defenders find that the horse is far more useful than their traditional long bows. Many of the commoners prefer to teach their sons and daughters to ride the horse than aim the bow and some even ridicule those that still use the long bow that for centuries have kept us safe from the monstrous hordes.;;;;;;;;x

HKR10B;No, it is better to overcome the weakness they are born with.;;;;;;;;;x
HKR11_DESC;As the adults left I was left alone. By the night the cold is unberable.;;;;;;;;;x
HKR11A;I'll just close my eyes for a second.;;;;;;;;;x
HKR12_DESC;The Arbiters returned the next morning with the body of my child. They say he died during the night. They offer to give him a full warriors funeral, as is custom, and add them to the list of the fallen.;;;;;;;;;x
HKR12A;Codes I hope they didn't suffer.;;;;;;;;;x
HKR13_DESC;As I near the gate for my fortress my legion stands at attention. I am ready for my Last Battle I will die as a on my feet with a sword in my hand and armor on my chest. The only question is where will I die.;;;;;;;;;x
HK13A;The Mountains, the yeti, the wolfos, or the Aerolfos will kill me.;;;;;;;;;x
HKR13B;The Deserts, to face our enemy of old.;;;;;;;;;x
HKR13C;The Forests, to teach the bokoblin fear.;;;;;;;;;x
HKR13D;The Plains, to carve a  path through the cavalry.;;;;;;;;;x
HKR14_DESC;I've been searching the mountain for days. After days I've found 3 battlefields. A cave which I have witnessed wolfos wandering in and out and strewn with bones, a peak higher up which I have seen aerolfos patrolling, and what looks like a set of snow covered roofs.;;;;;;;;x
HKR14A;Wolfos will surely give me a warriors death.;;;;;;;;x
HKR14B;The Yeti are the superior foe. If they can't kill me nothing will.;;;;;;;;x
HKR14C;The Aerolfos may be weak but they are cunning.;;;;;;;;x
HKR15_DESC;The Wolfos were upon me before I event got half way to the cave. I defeated the first wave, then second, then third, it was only when the Alphas of the pack set upon me. Before I knew it my chest plate fell from me. The alpha male was on my throat before I could draw my back up sword.;;;;;;;;x
GD;A good death.;;;;;;;;x
HKR16_DESC;As I approach the Yeti village I hear a choras of roars and what sounds like an avalanche and see a cloud of snow. As the snow clears a see an array of large yeti. The leader step forward and pounds his club in the snow before charging.;;;;;;;;;x
FLE;For the Legion and the Exemplar!;;;;;;;;x
HKR17_DESC;I meet the lead warrior head on. My shield absorbs his first hit and my first strike disables him. My next strike brings his bodyguard to his knees. By before I can strike again a hit rings off of my helmet. As I try to get back on my feet one of the warriors brings his club down on me.;;;;;;;;x
HKR18_DESC;I meet the lead warrior head on. My shield absorbs his first hit but shatters my wooden limb. He brings his club down again knocking me to the ground. As the warrior raises his club again for a finishing blow I bring my sword down on his side rendering a mortal blow before his club connects with my helmet one last time.;;;;;;;;x
HKR19_DESC;Before I make it half way up the pinalce the Aerolfos descend on me like a swarm of ravens. One darts trying to spear or cut me before retreating only for me to grab them and dash them against the ground, cut them, or bash them with my shield. This continues till I am out of breath before a red Aerolfos descends on me instead of bringing it's sword down on me it inhales and lets out a breath of fire. The heat is intense then seems to vanish only to be replaced by a cold I've never felt before.;;;;;;;;;x
HKR20_DESC;After weeks I of scouting I find what looks like like a zuna trading caravan. A cluster of what look like dinolfos huts, and an encampment of Gerudo.;;;;;;;;;x
HKR20A;Killing the Gerudo will help the legion.;;;;;;;;;x
HKR20B;The dinolfos will surely put up a threat.;;;;;;;;;x
HKR20C;Zuna traders will either give me death or supplies.;;;;;;;;;x
HKR21_DESC;As I aproach the Gerudo bandits I see sand being kicked up by what could only be horses. Before I see the riders arrows begin raining down upon me. Most bounce off of my armor but a couple find their mark in my sholders. As the horses get within site the bandits dismount not wishing to injure their prized mounts. With an oath I charge.;;;;;;;x
HKR22_DESC;I sit among the remains of the bandits my armor discarded around the sand. My wounds stay unbound as more of the bandits arrive no longer worrying about their horses. I stand with my short sword in hand.;;;;;;;;;x

thieving0_DESC;I have my supplies ready, my skin paints for camoflauge, my potions, lockpicks, and food. The only thing I need to do now is decide where am I going. The castles and keeps of the nobles will surely give me good treasure, but it will be more dangerous. I can steal from the village, there is more people and less things to steal, but they aren't as heavily armed. I could always steal from travelers, but I will have no idea what I get.;;;;;;;;;x
thieving0A;The riches of the keeps are to tempting;;;;;;;;;x

thieving3C;Scaling the wall should be easy;;;;;;;;;x
thieving3D;Maybe another mark;;;;;;;;x
thieving4_DESC;I waited till next day's delivery and snuck into one of the potion crates, I tossed most of the potions out along the road. When we arrived the guard complained about the weight but he still put me down with the rest of the crates.;;;;;;;;;x
thieving5_DESC;I waited till next day's delivery and snuck into one of the potion crates, I tossed most of the potions out along the road. When we arrived the guard complained about the weight.

thieving5A;Don't move a muscle;;;;;;;;;x
thieving5B;SCAMPER!;;;;;;;;;x

thieving7_DESC;The guard fishes around with his hand barrely missing me. He removes his hand and then a flair of pain and something hot running down my abdomen. As the voices rise around me I come to the realization I had been stabbed.;;;;;;;;;x
TE;I guess my crime spree is over.;;;;;;;;;x
thieving8_DESC;I bolted the guards yelled and a couple stumbled, but one with his bow at the ready fired. The arrow hit me right in the chest. The clouds are above me now and the sun beaming down on. Just like sunning on the beach.;;;;;;x
thieving9_DESC;The tunnel to the garden fount was longer than I thought, but I was able to find the end just as the guard walked by.;;;;;;;;;x
thieving10_DESC;The tunnel to the garden fountain is longer than I thought. The light at the end seems to keep getting smaller and smaller. My lungs burn for air and panic sets. I need air. NOW. I take in a deep breath but only water enters my lungs. Everything is dark. The light gone.;;;;;;;x
thieving11_DESC;The tunnel to the garden fountain is longer than I thought. I come up but right at the waters edge I see a guard staring in the water.;;;;;;;x
thieving11A;Must not move;;;;;;;;;x

thieving12_DESC;I can't make it back to the moat. My lungs burn. I need to take a breath.;;;;;;;;;x
IN;I'm IN;;;;;;;;;x
thieving13_DESC;I'm in the castle. The only question is where do I go. I could search the servents quarters, the guards quarters, or the noble's quarters.;;;;;;;;;x
thieving13A;The servents are the safest.;;;;;;;;;x
thieving13B;The guards can give me great weapons my people can't make.;;;;;;;;;x
thieving13C;The noble quarters will surely give me great gifts.;;;;;;;;;x
thieving14_DESC;As I enter the sevents quarters I over hear a servent talking about another that had been acting suspicious. I quickly spot said servent leaving his quarters and heading for the delivery area.;;;;;;;;;x
thieving14A;I'll follow him this may have good loot;;;;;;;;;x
thieving14B;No, I won't waste time on a rumor.;;;;;;;;;x
thieving15_DESC;After following the servent for serveral minutes he sits and waits for what seems like ages in the delivery bay. As I'm getting ready to give up a woman enters wearing a rich dress. After a few minutes it becomes apparent the liege's daughter is sleeping with a servent.;;;;;;;x
thieving15A;A waste of time.;;;;;;;x
thieving16_DESC;I follow the servent for a while I watch as he puts something in under a stone in the delivery room.;;;;;;;x
thieving16A;Lets see what he left;;;;;;;;x
thieving17_DESC;Inside the dead drop is a letter. It describes a burning passion for a woman. I hear footsteps coming from behind and quickly place the letter back and go back to the shadows. A older woman in a rich dress enters and retreves the letter depositing another letter.;;;;;;x
thieving17A;Looks like someone is having an affair;;;;;;;x
thieving18_DESC;As the sun gets ready to rise I leave the castle with a small sack of rupees. My winnings from pickpocketing and stealing the servents meager pay;;;;;;x
thieving18A;It's not much;;;;;;x
thieving19;As the sun gets ready to rise I leave the castle with a small sack of rupees. My winnings from stealing from the guards earnings.;;;;;;;x
thieving20;There is a rumor that one of the guards is seeing someone, but for some reason he doesn't want anyone to know.;;;;;;x
thieving20A;Is he seeing someone or hidding something?;;;;;;x
thieving21_DESC;As I follow the guard he acts like he is patrolling the grounds but he quickly diverts and heads for the servents quarters. He enters a room close to the kitchens after a short period of eavs dropping I gather enough he his in a relationship with the head chef's daughter.;;;;;;;x
thieving21A;This may be valuble if I was a spymaster;;;;;;;;x
thieving22_DESC;As I follow the guard he acts as if he is on a patrol but quickly leaves the castle. After a few minutes of walking we come to a clearing. In the center is the body of another guard with a note still in his fist. The living guard begins digging a grave but I quickly distract him by making noise in the opposite direction causing him to run.;;;;;;;x
thieving22A;I quickly descend on the body looking for equipment.;;;;;;x
thieving23_DESC;As I descend on the body I hear a twig snap and a sharp pain in my stomatch, I look down as someone right behind me starts yelling for the guards. I fall on the body with the sword still in my stomach....the sound of both of our murderer franticly running back to the castle.;;;;;;;x
thieving24_DESC;As I make my way through the guard quarters one a pass guard stops and then continues on.;;;;;;;x
thieving24A;Remain in hidding.;;;;;;;x
thieving24B;Make a break for it;;;;;;;x
thieving25_DESC;As I emerge from my hidding place the world goes black. The distant sound of heavy foot steps growing ever closer is all I can hear.;;;;;;;;x
thieving26_DESC;As the sun begins to rise I exit the castle my large bag of rupees ove my shoulder and a smile on my face.;;;;;;;x
thieving26A;A good haul;;;;;;;x
thieving27_DESC;As I enter the noble quarters I notice a child in rich clothes running with something clutched in his hands.;;;;;;;x
thieving27A;He may lead me to a good find;;;;;;;x
thieving27B;A child with a toy no doubt;;;;;;;;x
thieving28_DESC;As I follow the child he repeatedly looks behind as if he is worried to be followed. He enters a room containing a girl close to his age equally dressed. They proceed to play together with a set of dolls.;;;;;;x
thieving28A;A waste of time.;;;;;;;x
thieving29_DESC;As I follow the child he repeatedly looks behind as if he is worried about being followed. He nears a door and unlocks it. As he exits I pick the keys from him and enter. Revealing a large room filled with armor and valuble rupees.The only question is.....what do I take.;;;;;;;;;x
thieving29A;The armor;;;;;;x
thieving29B;The bow;;;;;;;x
thieving29C;The sword;;;;;;x
thieving30_DESC;Wanted posters of me are up all over town. Guard patrols are everywhere.;;;;;;x
thieving30A;I need to lay low till the heat dies down;;;;;;;;x
thieving31_DESC;I ran into one of my fellow thievies. He said that he tried to break into a manor that was said to have a lot of treasures just laying around. He said that he scouted it out and would be willing to give me his map for 20 rupees.;;;;;;;x
thieving31A;It may be worth it.;;;;;;x
thieving31B;Safe journey home, but no thanks.;;;;;;x
thieving32_DESC;The map is very well detailed, but only has the outside. It shows an entrance through a old hidden passage which has been bricked up, but the passage has be taken over bay keese. There's a window in the library, the owner of the house usually in there till midnight and is very lightly guarded.;;;;;;;;x
thieving32A;The passage should be quickest.;;;;;;;x
thieving32B;The library may be the safest;;;;;;;x
thieving33_DESC;The passage was luckily devoid of keese, probably out feeding on someone's cucco. As I neared the bricked up wall the only sound was my footsteps. I removed the bricks slowly being sure not to make any unneeded sound, after I made it in I put the bricks back.;;;;;;x
thieving34_DESC;The passage was luckily devoid of keese, probably out feeding on someone's cucco. As I neared the bricked up wall I hear a couple of hushed voices.;;;;;;;x
thieving34A;I can either wait for them to leave;;;;;;x
thieving34B;or take my chances and go inside.;;;;;;x
thieving35_DESC;As I entered the cave it quickly became apparent that the keese are still in the cave. There is enough keese on the ceiling that would be sure to ensure my death within seconds.;;;;;;x
thieving35A;Douse my torch and try to make my way through the tunnel;;;;;;x
thieving35B;I should wait for the keese to leave then try again;;;;;;x
thieving35C;I should try the library entrance;;;;;;;;;x
thieving36_DESC;Scalling the manor's wall was easy. As I neared the window I can hear snoring. A quick glance shows the master of the house asleep at a study desk and countless artifacts.;;;;;;;;x
thieving36A;I could take my chances and sneak in;;;;;;;;x
thieving36B;Or give up.;;;;;;;x
thieving37_DESC;The sound of wings is all I can ear and the glow of hundreds of pairs of eyes are all I can see. Before the keese descend on me.;;;;;;x
thieving38_DESC;As I carefully removed the stones the sound of wings came from behind, picking up the pace I entered the celler and took cover. Just in time as a swarm of keese descend on the couple, their screams ring through the manor.;;;;;;x
thieving38A;A black mark;;;;;;x
thieving39_DESC;After gaining entrance I have scouted the manor. Then in the celler there is a locked door. There is the library with the sleeping owner, it has enough small artifacts that I can make a large profit.;;;;;;;;x #magic rods #masks
#thieving39A;The armor can either be of use or profit.;;;;;;;x
thieving39A;There must be something behind that door.;;;;;;;x
thieving39B;The library's artifacts can be profitable.;;;;;;;x
thieving40_DESC;The owner of the house continues to snore. After a quick survey I find the four easiest and most valuble artifacts. However the owner has a large key on his belt.;;;;;;x
thieving40A;Grab the artifacts and leave.;;;;;;x
thieving40B;The key may open the door.;;;;;;;x
thieving41_DESC;As the key comes off the owner's belt a servent walks in. She screams and I run.;;;;;;;x
thieving41A;If I survive I'll need to lay low;;;;;;x
thieving42_DESC;As I run the sound of hounds and guards grow ever closer. Before I relize what happened my face is on the ground.;;;;;;x
thieving43_DESC;As I near the door I find lightly guarded, being passed every 5 minutes. The door is locked by a large key, the hole located in the center. I may be able to unlock it or I may find the key.;;;;;;x
thieving43A;I'll try to pick the lock;;;;;;;;x
thieving43B;I'll try to find the key;;;;;;;;x
thieving44_DESC;Inside the room is a single blue chest and some books all not very valuble. ;;;;;;;;x
thieving44A;Inside the chest is a single silver rupee;;;;;;;;x
thieving45A;Inside the chest is two silver rupees;;;;;;;;x
thieving46A;Inside the chest is a single large golden rupee;;;;;;;;x
thieving47_DESC;After several lock pics it becomes apparent I may not be able to unlock it.;;;;;;;;x
