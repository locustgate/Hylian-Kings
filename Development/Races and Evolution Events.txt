With Races we could make Evolution events that could change a race into one of their
descendants or possible relatives, similar to the culture change events in Vanilla.
This would be a way people could play a Race like the Rito without having a map change.
So here are some proposals of both culture groups, and possible evolution events.

Group Hylian:
Hylian/Skylofters (Perhaps some Hylians were left on the Surface and became the Round-ears)
Hyrulean (Little/East/West/New/Calatian/Tolemacian/etc.)
Ho Ho

Normal Human/Round Ear:
Should be races who normally cannot make magic of their own.
Round Ears(Ordonian/Eldin/Horon/Labrynnan/Arcadian/Hytopian/etc.)
Yamatami
Arcadian's parent could be Calatian.
Cobble/Papuchian (perhaps these two should be together)

Lost Tribes (Human-like beigns with great Magic):
Sheikah
Gerudo
Wind Tribe
Wizzrobe
Darknut/Dark Tribe/Interlopers
Twili
Mermaids
(Minish/Picori could also be placed here)
(Cobble/Papuchian could also be placed here)
(Lokomo could also be placed here, since they are a magical race like the Sheikah, and possibly older than Hylians)
(Zuna could also be placed here, as it is not certain if they are living cactus)
(Kokiri and Skull Kids could also be placed here)

Electrical/Machine:
Ancient Robots

Earth Tribes:
Mogma
Keaton

Subterranians:
Subrosians
Salonians
Garos

Ice Tribes:
Anouki (Can be present on the map in a mountain range near Cobble, since they arrived to Spirit Continent later)
Yeti (Can live in the Snowhead mountains area like in TP)
Yook (also live near the Anouki)

Spiritian (Spirit Continent):
Lokomo
Papuchian
New Hyrulean
(Perhaps this group would be better consolidated into others.)

Gorons:
Gorons (all kinds)

Zora:
Parella
River Zora
Ocean/Sea/Lake Zora
Geozard

Water:
Fishmen
Maiamai

Avian:
Loftwings
Watarara
Oocca
Rito

Fae:
Great Fairy 
Lesser Fairy (for characters like Navi, Tatl, Tael, etc.)
Demon
Deity/Spirits (Valoo, Fi, Deku/Maku Trees, Jabu Jabu, etc.)
Minish/Picori
Kokiri (Forest Spirits, but in magical bodies)
Skull Kids (said to be Kokiri lost in the Lost Woods, but could also be a separate Forest Spirit from deeper inside the Lost Woods, but since most are not bad they should either go in the Fae or Plant groups(their wooden bodies and sounds are similar to Koroks))
Tingles (normal being changed into Tingles by Uncle Rupee)

Plant (without Zuna, could be named Forest):
Kikwi
Deku
Korok
(Kokiri and Skull Kids could also be placed here)
Zuna (Could also be placed in Lost Tribes)

Animal:
Monkey

Blin:
All the Blins

Reptilian:
Lfos (all)
Tokay

Undead:
Stalfos/Stalchildren
Redead
Gibdos
Undead Ikanian

Otherworld:
Lorulean (could also be placed in Hylian)
Terminan (could also be placed in Hylian)
Ikanian (could be also be placed in Lost Tribe, and givien a Hyrule world equivallent (maybe Sheikah could be equivallent))

Evolution events:
Some evolution events could create some of the future Races like Rito or Koroks, and also bring back ones that die out.
Example: If the Kokiri race disappears, Hylians settling in the Kokiri forest could trigger an event to evolve them into Kokiri.
Cobble living in the Spirit Continent could evolve into Papuchian
Rito could have a dual chance of evolution: from Zoras living on Mountains or Mountain Islands, or from the Watarara.
Koroks could evolve from either Skull Kids or Kokiri after the era of OoT.

Evolution Possibilities:
Hylians (Group) into any of the Lost Tribe group, if those disappear, only under certain living conditions
Hylians or Humans into Zuna (if living in a certain area)
Hylians into Kokiri (if in the Kokiri Forest)
Hylians/Humans into Stalfos (if in Lost Woods or certain desert areas)
Hylians/Humans into Redead/Gibdos from a curse event
Ocean/Sea/Lake Zora into Rito
Ocean/Sea/Lake Zora into River Zora (if disappeared)
River Zora into Ocean/Sea/Lake Zora (if disappeared)
Watarara into Rito
Wind Tribe into Rito
Loftwings into Watarara
Loftwings into Oocca
River Zora into Geozards
Mogma into Keatons
Mogma into Yeti
Yeti into Yook
Kikwi into Dekus
Kokiri into Koroks
Kokiri into Skull Kids
Skull Kids into Koroks
Subrosians into Garos and Salonians
Dark Tribe/Interlopers into Darknuts, Wizzrobe and Twili
Any of the other races into Demon, if they become changed or corrupted like Vaati did.
Other Possibilites abound:
Minish into Kokiri (possibly)
and so on.
